# Tunability of ML Algorithms

This project was developed as part of the Automated Machine Learning course during the fifth semester (2025/2026) at the Warsaw University of Technology.

The objective of this project is to analyze and compare different hyperparameter tuning methods and to determine new default configurations for selected machine learning algorithms.

Three supervised learning models were considered:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
Each algorithm was optimized using Random Search and Bayesian Optimization.

The goal was to evaluate the tunability of each algorithm - assessing how strongly its performance depends on proper hyperparameter configuration.

This project is based on the methodology and theoretical framework presented in:
[Philipp Probst, Anne-Laure Boulesteix & Bernd Bischl.
